This vignette outlines the philosophy behind `plot_ly()` through a series of examples (click on the static images to see the interactive version). In a nutshell, `plot_ly()` aims to: 

1. Provide sensible defaults/messages/warnings based on the information supplied, but still allows for full customization through [plotly.js](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js)' (the open source JavaScript graphing library which powers plotly) [figure reference](https://plot.ly/r/reference/).
2. Leverage useful concepts from the grammar of graphics (without requiring it to be used).

## Smart defaults, messages, warnings, errors

If no visualization type is specified, `plot_ly()` infers a sensible type based on the information provided. In this case, a numeric matrix (named `volcano`) is mapped to the `z` attribute, so a heatmap is a sensible default. 

```{r, message = TRUE}
library(plotly)
str(volcano)
plot_ly(z = ~volcano)
```


A heatmap is not the only way to visualize a numeric matrix. Since `plot_ly()` only _initializes_ a plotly object, 

we can change the default visualization type using any of the `add_*()` functions:

```{r}
add_surface(plot_ly(z = ~volcano))
```

There are a number of `add_*()` functions, for a number 

## Functional interface

Plotly's R package has a functional interface: every function takes a plotly object as it's first input argument and returns a modified plotly object. To make code more readable, plotly re-exports the pipe operator (`%>%`) from the magrittr package. The pipe operator takes the object on the left-hand side and injects it into the first argument (by default) of the function on the right-hand side. This allows us to read code from left to right instead of inside out.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# these two lines of code are equivalent, but the second is easier to read
plotly_POST(add_surface(plot_ly(z = ~volcano)))
plot_ly(z = ~volcano) %>% add_surface() %>% plotly_POST()
```




```{r}
plot_ly(diamonds, x = ~cut)
plot_ly(diamonds, y = ~cut)
```


To create a plotly visualization, start with `plot_ly()`.

```{r}
library(plotly)
plot_ly(economics, x = ~date, y = ~unemploy / pop)
```

A plotly visualization is composed of one (or more) trace(s), and every trace has a `type` (the default type is 'scatter'). The arguments/properties that a trace will respect ([documented here](https://plot.ly/r/reference)) depend on it's type. A scatter trace respects `mode`, which can be any combination of "lines", "markers", "text" joined with a "+":

```{r}
library(plotly)
plot_ly(economics, x = ~date, y = ~unemploy / pop, 
        type = "scatter", mode = "markers+lines")
```

You can manually add a trace to an existing plot with `add_trace()`. In that case, you'll want to either `name` your traces, or hide the legend by setting `showlegend = FALSE`

```{r}
m <- loess(unemploy / pop ~ as.numeric(date), data = economics)
p <- plot_ly(economics, x = ~date, y = ~unemploy / pop, name = "raw") 
add_lines(p, y = ~fitted(m), name = "loess")
```

__plotly__ was designed with a [pure, predictable, and pipeable interface](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/41902/pipe-dsls.pdf) in mind, so you can also use the `%>%` operator to create a visualization pipeline:

```{r}
economics %>%
  plot_ly(x = ~date, y = ~unemploy / pop) %>% 
  add_lines(y = ~fitted(m)) %>%
  layout(showlegend = F)
```

TODO: talk about dplyr verbs!

```{r}
library(dplyr)
economics %>%
  mutate(rate = unemploy / pop) %>%
  plot_ly(x = ~date, y = ~rate) %>% 
  filter(rate == max(rate)) %>%
  layout(
    showlegend = F, 
    annotations = list(x = ~date, y = ~rate, text = "Peak", showarrow = T)
  )
```

Although these functions output special "plotly data frames", `plot_ly()` doesn't require a data frame for input. This makes chart types that accept a `z` argument especially easy to use if you have a numeric matrix:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
s <- plot_ly(z = volcano, type = "surface")
```

If you have [a free plotly account](https://plot.ly/r/getting-started/), `plotly_POST()` makes it easy to host/share any plotly figure (click on the image below to see the interactive version).

```{r, eval = FALSE}
plotly_POST(s)
```

## Special arguments

The __plotly__ function arguments used thus far are documented in [the figure reference](https://plot.ly/r/reference), but there are a handful of additional arguments not described in the reference that make common visualizations a bit easier. These arguments are very much inspired by the semantics of ggplot2's `qplot()` in the sense that a scales are automatically applied these variables.

### The color argument

#### Qualitative color mappings

If a ordinal variable (aka a non-ordered factor variable) is assigned to color, then a qualitative color palette is used by default.

```{r}
plot_ly(iris, x = ~Petal.Length, y = ~Petal.Width, 
        color = ~Species, mode = "markers")
```

If you want to change the default palette, it's recommended that you provide a <http://colorbrewer2.org> qualitative pallette name (e.g., "Set1" or "Accent") to the colors argument.

```{r}
plot_ly(iris, x = ~Petal.Length, y = ~Petal.Width, 
        color = ~Species, colors = "Set1", mode = "markers")
```

In this case, the palette consists of 9 colors and the default behavior is to pick colors that are furthest apart ("#E41A1C", "#FF7F00", and "#999999").

```{r}
cols <- RColorBrewer::brewer.pal(9, "Set1")
scales::show_col(cols)
```

If you'd like more control over the mapping, you can provide a vector of colors (of appropriate length).

```{r}
cols <- RColorBrewer::brewer.pal(nlevels(iris$Species), "Set1")
plot_ly(iris, x = ~Petal.Length, y = ~Petal.Width, 
        color = ~Species, colors = cols, mode = "markers")
```

#### Sequential color mappings

If either a numeric or an ordered factor is mapped to color, `plot_ly()` applies a sequential color scale by default.

```{r}
plot_ly(iris, x = ~Petal.Length, y = ~Petal.Width, 
        color = ~as.ordered(Species), mode = "markers")
```

In the case of continuous numeric variables, `plot_ly()` performs a linear mapping between the data and an interpolated color pallette.

```{r}
plot_ly(iris, x = ~Petal.Length, y = ~Petal.Width, 
        color = ~Sepal.Length, mode = "markers")
```

The colors argument takes arbitrary color codes of arbitrary length. Here is how we could use it to replicate the default mapping in ggplot2.

```{r}
plot_ly(iris, x = ~Petal.Length, y = ~Petal.Width, 
        color = ~Sepal.Length, colors = c("#132B43", "#56B1F7"), 
        mode = "markers")
```

#### Diverging color mappings

To obtain a diverging color mapping, just provide a diverging palette to the colors argument.

```{r}
plot_ly(iris, x = ~Petal.Length, y = ~Petal.Width, 
        color = ~Sepal.Length, colors = "PuOr", mode = "markers")
```

### The symbol argument

To encode values using symbols, use the symbol argument.

```{r}
plot_ly(iris, x = ~Petal.Length, y = ~Petal.Width, 
        symbol = ~Species, mode = "markers")
```

To change the default symbols used, use the symbols argument. All the valid symbol types are listed [here](https://plot.ly/r/reference/#marker).

```{r}
plot_ly(iris, x = ~Petal.Length, y = ~Petal.Width, mode = "markers",
        symbol = ~Species, symbols = c("cross", "square", "triangle-down"))
```
