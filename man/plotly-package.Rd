\section{Authentication}{


There are a few different options. First, you can pass in your username and key
to the \code{plotly} function as parameters, like \code{plotly(<yourusername>,
<yourkey>)}. Second, you can set your username and key as options temporarily
within each R session by executing \code{options(plotlyUsername='<yourusername>')}
and \code{options(plotlyKey='<yourkey>')}. Third, you set your username and key
permanently (until removed) in your .Rprofile file. Put entries in for each of
username and password: \code{options(plotlyUsername='<yourusername>')} and
\code{options(plotlyKey='<yourkey>')}.
